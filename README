1) Requirements
Python 3
Lybraries: argparse, os, io, time, datetime, math, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pylab

2) Installation
Download the macrospin models (.py files). Make sure all the libraries from above are installed on your system.

3) How to run the model
There are defaults for all parameters. mA_mQ_mB.py employs the argparse library for easy parameter parsing. spice.py uses the same model as mA_mQ_mB.py, but without argparse (everything must be set within the script). mA_mQ.py is a simpliefied version of the previous two, where the system is reduced from three interacting macro spins to only two macro spins.
